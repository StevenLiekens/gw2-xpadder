# Xpadder for Guild Wars 2
This repository contains controller layouts and profiles for use in Guild Wars 2.

# How To: Controller Layouts
1. Copy the contents of the controller layout that you wish to use (*.xpaddercontroller)
2. Open Xpadder
3. Click the button whose icon looks like a controller
4. Click `Paste...` in the dropdown menu
5. From the same menu, save the layout if you plan to keep it.

# How To: Profiles
1. Copy the contents of the profile that you wish to use (*.xpadderprofile)
2. Open Xpadder
3. Click the button whose icon looks like a text document
4. Click `Paste...` in the dropdown menu
5. From the same menu, save the profile if you plan to keep it.

# Notes
All profiles are based on two assumptions:
 - `Toggle Action Camera` is bound to <kbd>C</kbd>
 - you have not unassigned any of the default keybinds
